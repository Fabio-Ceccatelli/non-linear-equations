# Nonlinear equations and root-finding Algorithms

>Nonlinear equations are mathematical expressions that involve variables raised to powers greater than one, multiplied together, or subjected to transcendental functions such as exponential or trigonometric functions. Unlike linear equations, there is no formula or set of rules that can be applied to isolate the variable and find a unique solution. Therefore, iterative numerical algorithms are required to approximate the roots of nonlinear equations.

## Bisection Method

The bisection method is an iterative algorithm that repeatedly bisects an interval and selects the subinterval where the function changes sign, reducing the interval size by half at each iteration until the desired accuracy is achieved. The advantage of the bisection method is that it always converges to a root of a continuous function if the initial interval contains a root and the function is monotonic in that interval. **However, the convergence is slow compared to other methods, and it requires knowing the initial interval that contains the root.**

## Secant Method

The secant method is an iterative algorithm that approximates the root of a nonlinear equation by drawing a secant line through two points on the function and finding the intersection of that line with the x-axis, replacing one of the points with this new estimate and repeating until the desired accuracy is achieved. The advantage of the secant method is that it converges faster than the bisection method and does not require an initial interval. However, it may fail to converge or converge to a wrong root if the function has a flat region or oscillates.

## Tangent Method (Newton's Method)

The tangent method, also known as Newton's method, is an iterative algorithm that approximates the root of a nonlinear equation by using the slope of the tangent line at an initial estimate to find the intersection of the tangent with the x-axis, replacing the initial estimate with this new estimate and repeating until the desired accuracy is achieved. The advantage of the tangent method is that it converges faster than the secant method, and it has quadratic convergence near a simple root. However, it may fail to converge or converge to a wrong root if the initial estimate is too far from the true root or the function has a flat region or a singularity.

In summary, the choice of a root-finding algorithm depends on the properties of the function, the required accuracy, and the available initial information. The bisection method is reliable but slow, the secant method is faster but less reliable, and the tangent method is the fastest but most sensitive to the initial estimate and the function's behavior.# non-linear-equations
